    "invitation": "To Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\n221B Baker Street,\nLondon.\n\nDear Mr. Holmes,\n\nI find myself in need of your unique talents once again. A most perplexing and troubling case has arisen at Blackwood Hall, the estate of the late Sir Reginald Blackwood. Last night, Sir Reginald was found dead in his study, stabbed with one of his own ceremonial daggers. The door was locked from the inside, and the window was bolted shut—an impossible crime, by all accounts.\n\nThe family and guests are in a state of agitation, and the staff whisper of curses and phantoms. I fear that without your keen eye and deductive reasoning, this case may remain unsolved.\n\nI have secured your invitation to Blackwood Hall. A carriage will collect you and Dr. Watson at your earliest convenience. Time is of the essence, as a storm threatens to cut off the estate from the outside world.\n\nYours sincerely,\nInspector G. Lestrade, Scotland Yard",
    "description": "The case of The Murder at Blackwood Hall is full of mystery and dark secrets. The mansion feels alive, with shadowy hallways and hidden rooms that whisper tales of the past. Sir Reginald Blackwood, a wealthy and powerful man, has been killed in his own Study. The door was locked from the inside, and the window was bolted shut—making it seem impossible for the killer to enter or exit.\n\nThe suspects are as puzzling as the crime:\nLady Eleanor Blackwood, Sir Reginald’s wife, whose calm demeanor belies her inner coldness and the fortune she stands to inherit.\nVictor Blackwood, Sir Reginald’s estranged son, an artist with a volatile temper and a history of clashes with his father over money and lifestyle.\nMiss Clara Hastings, Sir Reginald’s niece, quiet and polite, yet her hidden plans make her hard to read.\nDr. Jonathan Graves, the family doctor, whose nervous behavior and odd disappearance at times raise suspicion.\nMr. Harold Whitaker, Sir Reginald’s business partner, embroiled in financial disputes and a crumpled contract of dubious nature.\nMrs. Beatrice Poole, the long-serving housekeeper, keeper of family secrets and witness to muddy footprints outside the Study window.",
